       "html": "<p>A Critical Appraisal Task (CAT) is a training tool designed to enable trainees to address a clinical question using the best available evidence. Trainees are expected to appraise the relevant literature and, based upon this, to concisely provide a rationale for their chosen management. These tasks equip the trainee to continually adjust management approaches during their career as a paediatric surgeon, as new information becomes available. CATs are designed to approximate the framework expected during written components of the Fellowship Examination.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Critical appraisal is the process of carefully and systematically assessing the outcome of scientific research (evidence) to judge its reliability, value and relevance in a particular context. Critical appraisal is more than a review of the current literature and categorisation of level of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>This Critical Appraisal Task (CAT) is intended to develop your skill as a healthcare professional to determine the extent to which the research evidence is applicable, unbiassed and relevant to your patients.</p>\n\n<p>The learning outcomes of this CAT are to enable you to:</p>\n\n<p>- organise the presentation to inform the reader of the key concepts in a logical and well-constructed format;</p>\n\n<p>- demonstrate an ability to advance a logical argument using supporting scientific literature, including appropriately cited references;</p>\n\n<p>- appraise and summarise the scientific literature to support your response to the questions;</p>\n\n<p>- assess the relative value of different treatment options; and</p>\n\n<p>- formulate evidence-based opinions in areas of importance or controversy in paediatric surgery.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The CAT question will be available from 11.59 PM (AEST) on Sunday 28th August 2022.</p>\n\n<p>You are required to submit your response to the CAT in .pdf format by 11:59 PM (AEDT) on Sunday 20th November 2022.</p>\n\n<p>You will receive feedback from your facilitators, and you may be asked to resubmit your initial response to the CAT.</p>\n\n<p>CATs are open to all trainees. Trainees must submit and pass six CATs during training. It is mandatory for Mid- and Senior-SET trainees to submit a CAT unless they have fulfilled the requirement. If you choose to submit before Mid-SET, you will be marked at Mid-SET level.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIn regards to the format, we suggest:</h2>\n\n<p>- using grades of recommendation&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- when quoting levels of evidence, please let us know at the beginning of the submission what standard you are using i.e. Oxford, NHRMC, so it can be marked accordingly&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- dot points rather than full essay style&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- word limit is a guide</p>\n\n<p>-- please include the number of words used</p>\n\n<p>-- not acceptable if &gt;10% over the word limit</p>\n\n<p>-- you can have a satisfactory answer using less than the word limit&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- tables summarising the levels of evidence for each study at the end of the submission are not necessary; we would prefer that the important studies are analysed in your paper itself&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- include what you will do for the patient at hand and ensure that you have justified it using the literature</p>\n"
