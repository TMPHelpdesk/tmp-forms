     "html": "<p><strong>Supervisors and Trainees please refer to instructions below</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p>This form replaces the Trainee Assessment Form: Specialist Surgical Training Assessment Form (Dec 2005).</p>\n<br />\n<p>Trainees are assessed against the specified logbook and research requirements, and the nine RACS competencies for surgery. All sections of this form are to be completed.</p>\n<br />\n<p>The form is intended for use as an In-Training or Mid-Run (Formative) assessment tool as well as an End-of-Term (Summative) assessment tool. The Board requires that\nTrainees submit this completed form to the Board three times per 12 months, but the Board encourages its use by Trainees and Supervisors more frequently than this.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe terminology used had been adapted to conform to the NOTSS terminology in describing cognitive and behavioural aspects of performance and aligned with performance\ndescriptors from the RACS Competency Standards. Trainees are assessed against the performance descriptors appropriate to their level in the SET program. Trainees\napplying for the Part II Examination are assessed against the SET5+ level.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nFor most Competency Categories the following four point grading system is used:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exceeds</strong> (Performance was of a consistently high standard and well above the trainee's current level within the SET program),</p>\n<p><strong>Achieved </strong> (Performance was of a satisfactory standard or of a satisfactory standard but could be improved in certain non-critical aspects),</p>\n<p><strong>Borderline</strong> (Competency not yet achieved and improvement is needed. It is considered trainee will achieve competency in time),</p>\n<p><strong>Not Achieved</strong> (Performance endangered or potentially endangered patient safety, and serious remedial action is required).</p>\n<p>A middle or average grade has been intentionally omitted.</p>\n<br />\n<p>For the Competency Categories both the Trainee and the Supervisor are to enter Scores. These Competencies have individual “Elements” or sub-descriptors. These are to be\nscored individually. <strong>The Trainee should enter all their scores before the Supervisor. </strong>The purpose of this is to indicate the degree of trainee insight into their training\nprogress.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe Supervisor is to derive an overall score based on the Supervisor score for individual elements for each of the Competency categories specified.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Some Competencies constitute “Essential Criteria” which the Supervisor alone will score. These are indicators of minimum behaviour standards for Surgeons and Trainees.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Space for Supervisor and Trainee Comment and Overall Recommendations is provided near the end of the form. Comments must be made.</p>\n,br />\n<p>The Supervisor is to provide an overall assessment (page 12) based on the Trainee’s performance in each of the Competencies and Essential Criteria. A Not Achieved\noverall rating in any Competency or Not Achieved rating in any Essential Criteria will result in an Not Achieved overall assessment. A Borderline overall rating in two or\nmore Competencies will result in a Borderline overall assessment.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Supervisors are strongly encouraged to consult widely in compiling this form and to maintain documentation of trainee performance (e.g. DOPS, MiniCEX and Problem Based\nDiscussions).</p>"
